OrbitalTag
==========

Possible game prototype or just HTML testbed - too soon to know.

_If_ this goes anywhere, the goal will probably be to chase down dots by changing orbits that are linked to speed.

If it goes nowhere, it's a neat gimmick that modifies an animated SVG image on the fly.

Bugs
----

Changing the speed of the "clock hand"'s rotation also changes its position in rotation.  It seems to be a matter of retaining its current percentage sweep, but maybe not.
